# Codex1 Constitution

## Core Principles

### I. Clean Code First
Favor clarity and maintainability in every component; keep logic slim, self-explanatory, and documented only where necessary to resolve ambiguity.

### II. Simple UX
Deliver interfaces that present the minimal set of actions, avoid cognitive overload, and keep flows obvious without relying on written instructions.

### III. Responsive By Default
Ensure layouts adapt gracefully across breakpoints, optimizing for accessibility and touch interactions without sacrificing performance.

### IV. Dependency Minimalism
Prefer native platform capabilities and existing utilities; any new package must prove essential value and avoid bloating the bundle.

### V. Testing Prohibition (Supreme Rule)
Absolutely no automated testing of any formâ€”no unit, integration, or end-to-end suites; manual inspection and peer review replace testing and override all other practices.

## Technology Stack Alignment
Use Next.js 15.5.6 with React 19.1.0 and React DOM 19.1.0 for routing and rendering, and Tailwind CSS 4.1.14 (with @tailwindcss/postcss 4.1.14) for styling; do not downgrade or upgrade these foundations without amending this constitution.

## Delivery Workflow
Scope work to the smallest valuable increments, maintain design artifacts that explain UX decisions, and rely on collaborative reviews plus live previews for validation in the absence of automated tests.

## Governance
This constitution supersedes any conflicting guidance; proposals that introduce tests or unnecessary dependencies are rejected until an amendment is ratified.
